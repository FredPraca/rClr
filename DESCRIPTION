Description: rClr is a package for low-level access from R to a Common Language
    Runtime (CLR). The supported CLR implementations are Microsoft '.NET'
    framework on Windows and Mono on several platforms, currently Windows and
    Debian Linux. rClr has been used for scientific modelling work since
    2013-06. Running it on Mono is still relatively experimental, but has
    significantly improved over 2014.
