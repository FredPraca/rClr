#' rClr is a package for low-level access from R to a Common Language Runtime (CLR). The supported CLR implementations are Microsoft '.NET'
#' framework on Windows and Mono on several platforms, currently Windows and at least Debian Linux. rClr has been used in scientific modelling work since
#' 2013-06. Running it on Mono has been relatively experimental, but as of November 2014 several factors have enabled very near functional parity with the Windows/.NET.
