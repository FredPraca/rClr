#' rClr is a package for low-level access from R to a Common Language
#' Runtime (CLR). The supported CLR implementations are Microsoft '.NET'
#' framework on Windows and Mono on several platforms, currently Windows and
#' Debian Linux. rClr has been used for scientific modelling work since
#' 2013-06. Running it on Mono is still relatively experimental, but has
#' significantly improved over 2014.
