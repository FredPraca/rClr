rClr is a package for low-level access from R to a Common Language Runtime (CLR). The supported CLR implementations are Microsoft '.NET'
framework on Windows and Mono on several platforms, currently Windows and at least Debian Linux. rClr has been used in scientific modelling work since
2013-06. Running it on Mono has been relatively experimental, but as of November 2014 several factors have enabled very near functional parity with the Windows/.NET.
