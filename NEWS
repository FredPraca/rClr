NEWS/ChangeLog for rClr
--------------------------

0.5-2	2013-09-21  beta 5
    o	Fix memory leaks for vectors created in R converted to .NET 
	arrays. Proper memory release is confirmed for at least numeric, 
	integer and character vector types. Part of this exercise, 
	rClr has been accepted by Coverity Scan (https://scan.coverity.com).
    I acknowledge Coverity for some helpful insights tracking defects in rClr.	
    o	Useful exception handling on MS.NET CLR: print out the details 
	of the innermost exception. This is a big improvement on the 
	unhelpful HRESULT codes previously reported.
    o	The hosting for the Mono runtime on Windows is included 
	in this release. Do note that date-time handling is not 
	passing many tests with the Mono CLR.
	
0.5-1	2013-06-16  beta 4
    o	Adding package documentation using knitr and R-markdown
    o	clrNew now with arguments
    o	Some support for 'enum' types
    o	Date-time handling is now using POSIXct classes instead of Date. 
	The temporal resolution is thus much better, however beware that 
	POSIXct is effectively a UTC time with a timezone conversion. 
	A lot of unit tests are in place around it, but date and time
	zone is a complicated topic.
    o	This release does not include Mono support; unfortunately 
	this is not yet usable as it is too unstable. There has 
	actually been major progress, but some new issues still 
	emerged.
